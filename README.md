Common Lisp 3D graphics code

This code is definitely not ready for primetime. It is very much a work in progress and a playground for my ideas.

More info about the thoughts behind this project at my blog:

There is no documentation beyond this file.

If you're brave enough, change the pathnames in main.lisp and eval the buffer.

You should see a graphics window appear (only tested on CCL and MacOS).

Type 'h' in the window to see the available key bindings.

Open demo.lisp and start evaluating the blocks of code. Things should appear in the graphics window.

Have fun.

TODO: many many things, including...
- ASDF or other package system
- documentation
- GUI -- OpenGL, Web, or other?
