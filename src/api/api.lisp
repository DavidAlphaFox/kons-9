(pax:defsection @introduction (:title "Introduction") "
Kons-9 is a 3D IDE written in Common Lisp.

This manual aspires to be a full description of the Lisp programming interface
to Kons-9. This manual presumes that you are familiar with Common Lisp
programming. (If you are not already a Common Lisp hacker then consider reading
[Practical Common Lisp](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/).)

Beware! This manual is new and incomplete. It will require the contributions of
many authors to achieve its goal of completeness. If the documentation you are
looking for is not yet written then please consider writing the first draft.

The documentation is prepared using [MGL-PAX](https://melisgl.github.io/mgl-pax-world/mgl-pax-manual.html)
by GÃ¡bor Melis.")
